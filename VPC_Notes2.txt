IP Address
============
4 octets, each octets has 8 bits - 2^32
0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255

CIDR - classless inter domain routing

VPC CIDR
==========

10.0.0.0/16 - first 2 octets blocked for network bits, remaining 2^16 = 65536 IP Address 

10.0.0.0
10.0.0.1
|
|
|
10.0.0.255

10.0.1.0
|
|
|
10.0.1.255

65536 servers we can configure inside VPC if VPC CIDR is set to 10.0.0.0/16

Subnet CIDR
==========

10.0.0.0/24 - first 3 octets blocked for VPC and subnet, remaining 2^8 = 256 IP Address

10.0.0.1

10.0.0.255

256 servers we can configure in subnet if Subnet CIDR is set to 10.0.0.0/24

when you have a subnet CIDR of 10.0.0.0/24, it means the first 24 bits (or the first three octets) 
are used to represent the network portion (VPC and subnet), and the remaining 8 bits (the last octet) 
are available for host addresses within that subnet.

1.First IP address (10.0.0.0 in this case) is reserved and is used to refer to the whole network. 
2.Last IP address (10.0.0.255 in this case) is reserved for the broadcast address, 
used to send a message to all devices in the subnet.
These two IP address are not assigned to any host in subnet.
So what 254 hosts we can configure per subnet

The subnet mask (/24 in your example) defines the division between the network portion and the host portion of the IP address.

Also, total number subnets we can create in VPC as per Subnet CIDR is set to 10.0.0.0/24 is 256


1a == 10.0.0.0/24 to 10.0.0.255 - 256 IP address
1b == 10.0.1.0/24 to 10.0.1.255 - 256 IP address


- Decideing VPC CIDR and Subnet CIDR is big process, networking people with architect will decide on this. 
- This will be taken care by networking team
