1. Create VPC  - IPV4 CIDR - 10.0.0.0/16 - expense
2. Create IGW  - expense
3. Attach IGW to VPC
4. Create subnets with in VPC
    expense-public-1a - subnet CIDR - 10.0.1.0/24
    expense-public-1b - subnet CIDR - 10.0.2.0/24
    expense-private-1a - subnet CIDR - 10.0.11.0/24
    expense-private-1b - subnet CIDR - 10.0.12.0/24
    expense-database-1a - subnet CIDR - 10.0.21.0/24
    expense-database-1b - subnet CIDR - 10.0.22.0/24
5. Create route tables with in VPC
    expense-public - Attach public subnets for this using edit subnet associations options.
        expense-public-1a
        expense-public-1b
    expense-private - Attach private subnets
        expense-private-1a
        expense-private-1b
    expense-database - Attach database subnets
        expense-database-1a 
        expense-database-1b
6. After Attaching subnets to respective route tables, we have adde entries also in route tables 
     - public subnets will get traffic from Gateway
     - In public route table make an entry "0.0.0.0/0" and in target select our Gateway.
     - public subnet will have route to Internet Gateway and private subnet will not have route to internet Gateway.
     - NAT Gateway: if you want to enable "egress internet" (to install packages) to the servers in private subnet, 
        you should create NAT Gateway in public subnet and provide route to private subnets
     - if traffic coming to server --> ingress
     - if server is sending traffic to internet -->egress
     - we will create NAT Gateway in "expense-public-1a" subnet, but for this first we need static IP/elastic IP address.
        The reason is, if for some reason NAT Gateway is turned OFF & ON, then IP address will change, to avoid this we need
        static IP address mandatory- this costly, even we can take from ISP
     - After creating static IP, we can create NAT Gateway for "expense-public-1a" subnet
     - Now in Private route table, make an entry "0.0.0.0/0" and in target select our NAT Gateway
     - Same way we can update database route table - "0.0.0.0/0" and in target select our NAT Gateway


This is Minimum setup for VPC

NAT meaning only egress traffic.
