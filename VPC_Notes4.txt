VPC Naming convention
======================
- don't repeat resource type in vpc name like "expense-vpc
- single VPC you are creating then name it as "this"
- Always use singular nouns for names (private subnet, internet Gateway)
- for human use "-" and for programs use "_"

Module should be tested while developing it.

# subnets and VPC's are peramanent, it will be created once only instances will change.
# separate AWS accounts will be there for Prod, dev, QA, UAT - in same VPC all environments code will not be present.
# different accounts for an application
# In startup companies, only one account.
# 10.0.0.1/32 - meaning one IP or one instance

For database subnet, we have allowed egress rules, this nothing but we allowing outgoing traffic for database.
dnf install mysql-server - my Ec2 is requesting internet to provide mysql-server package, here traffic is originated from the server.
for this reason we only allow egress traffic backend and database subnet
