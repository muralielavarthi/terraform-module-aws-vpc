VPC Naming convention
======================
- don't repeat resource type in vpc name like "expense-vpc
- single VPC you are creating then name it as "this"
- Always use singular nouns for names (private subnet, internet Gateway)
- for human use "-" and for programs use "_"

Module should be tested while developing it.
