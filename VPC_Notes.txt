Before cloud everything is on-premise data centers in companies

Disadvantages of on-premise data centers:
-----------------------------------------
Physical space, physical security, networking, power, firewalls, linux admins,
network admins, storage backups,disaster management, installing security updates and patching, severs cooling, maintaines

Virtual private cloud (VPC):
--------------------------
1. An isolated project space where we can create resources for a project.
2. we will have full control and access on this. 
3. Other projects will not have access to this VPC, cloud has given this gurantee.
4. Virtual private cloud means, logical seperation of physical severs.
