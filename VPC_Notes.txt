Before cloud everything is on-premise data centers in companies

Disadvantages of on-premise data centers:
-----------------------------------------
Physical space, physical security, networking, power, firewalls, linux admins,
network admins, storage backups,disaster management, installing security updates and patching, severs cooling, maintaines

Virtual private cloud (VPC):
--------------------------
1. An isolated project space where we can create resources for a project.
2. we will have full control and access.
3. Other projects will not have access to this VPC, cloud provider has given this gurantee.
4. Virtual private cloud means, logical seperation of physical severs.

Internet Gateway ==> To bring traffic to VPC (to provide Internet connection)
Databases ==> no outside person should have access to Database
Frontend ==> public, onyone in internet can open 
Routes ==> if there is route, you can reach the application, else you can't
High Availability
Each Region ==> 2 Availability zones (data centers)
1a Availability zone - one public subnet
1b Availability zone - one public subnet

1.public subnet, we host Frontend code
2.private subnet, we host backend code
3.private Database subnet, we host Databases

In project, we have to keep few applications in public and few applications private

IGW: An Internet Gateway is a networking device that connects private cloud environment 
to the broader internet. It's used to facilitate communication between internal networks (like a private cloud) 
and the internet, typically in cloud computing environments, such as AWS
